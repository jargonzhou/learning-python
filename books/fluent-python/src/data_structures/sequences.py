2. An Array of Sequences

types: `list`, `str`, `bytes`
sequence types: lists, tuples, arrays, queues
topics:
  list comprehension
  generator expression
  tuple as records
  tuple as immutable lists
  sequence unpacking
  sequence patterns
  slices

built-in sequences
- container sequences: hold items of different types - references
  - list, tuple, collections.dequeue
- flat sequences: hold items of a simple type - values
  - str, bytes, array.array
  
sequence types by mutablity
- mutable: list, bytearray, array.array, collections.deque - MutableSequence
- immutable: tuple, str, bytes - Sequence
