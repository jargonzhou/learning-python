# Uvicorn
* https://www.uvicorn.org/

> Uvicorn is an ASGI web server implementation for Python.
>
> Until recently Python has lacked a minimal low-level server/application interface for async frameworks. The [ASGI specification](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) fills this gap, and means we're now able to start building a common set of tooling usable across all async frameworks.
>
> Uvicorn currently supports HTTP/1.1 and WebSockets.
