* [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html): flake8 is a python tool that glues together pycodestyle, pyflakes, mccabe, and third-party plugins to check the style and quality of some python code.
* [GRPC](./grpc.ipynb)
* IPython
  * [ipython.ipynb](./ipython.ipynb)

* [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/):  Miniconda is a free, miniature installation of Anaconda Distribution that includes only conda, Python, the packages they both depend on, and a small number of other useful packages.
* [mock](https://mock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): mock is a library for testing in Python. It allows you to replace parts of your system under test with mock objects and make assertions about how they have been used. mock is now part of the Python standard library, available as `unittest.mock` in Python 3.3 onwards.
* [Pika](./pika.ipynb) 
* [pip.md](./pip.md)
* [Pipenv.md](./Pipenv.md)

* [Pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html): Pylint is a static code analyser for Python 2 or 3. The latest version supports Python 3.8.0 and above. Pylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard, looks for code smells, and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored.
* [PyMySQL](./PyMySQL.ipynb)
* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/): The pytest framework makes it easy to write small, readable tests, and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

It helps developers to easily share reusable code (in the form of a library) and programs (e.g., CLI/GUI tools implemented in Python), that can be installed with pip and uploaded to PyPI.
* [SQLAlchemy](./SQLAlchemy.ipynb)
* [tqdm](./tqdm.ipynb)
