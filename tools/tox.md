> tox - automation project
> 
> tox aims to automate and standardize testing in Python. It is part of a larger vision of easing the packaging, testing and release process of Python software (alongside `pytest` and `devpi`).
>
> tox is a generic virtual environment management and test command line tool you can use for:
>
> * checking your package builds and installs correctly under different environments (such as different Python implementations, versions or installation dependencies),
> * running your tests in each of the environments with the test tool of choice,
> * acting as a frontend to continuous integration servers, greatly reducing boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing.
